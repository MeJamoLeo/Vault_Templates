### 課題のフォーマット
0. Fallacy name
	1. Fallacy Description
	2. The quote and who said it
	3. Explanation of how the quote meets the requirements for this fallacy
	4. Explain who would be most influenced or convinced by the fallacy and why
0. Red Herring
	1. A Red Herring is a fallacy where someone talks about something unrelated to the main question or topic. This is done to distract people and avoid answering the original question or issue.
	2. The moderator asked the question "Do you believe Americans are better off than they were four years ago?" Harris's first sentence from her answer was "So... I was raised as a middle-class kid, and I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America."
	3. The moderator asked closed question, which is called YES/NO question, and this question was asking about result from past four years polices. However, she start having speech for her background and her vision. This means she does not answer the initial question the moderator asked, she changed the topic from evaluation from past four years result to introducing her polices. This situation matches the definition of Red Herring.
	4. This logical fallacy would influence supporters of Harris or those who care about the middle class because they may not notice that the original question was not directory addressed. They might feel connected to her plan.
0. Ad Hominem
	1. Focusing on the character instead of the argument itself creates the illusion of disproving their point
	2. Trump respond that "She does not have a plan. She copied Biden's plan. and it is like the four sentences, like run spot run. four sentences that it just, okay we will try to lower taxes. She does not have a plan. Take a look at our plan. She does not have a plan."
	4. They were supposed to debate about economics, but once Harris said "Trump doesn't have plan for you" , later, he respond such that. There two parts. The first ad hominem is Trump rejected Harries's polices because he think it was copied from Biden's policy. As a policy, no one matter it was copied or not because the point is the policy is critical solution for citizens, but he argued about that. The other is simplifying the opponent's plan to an extreme and mocking it shows a lack of respect and an intention to ridicule them. Trump offended Harris ability or character instead of debating economics.
	5. Voters who do not know the details of Harris's policies might get the impression that "she has no plan," even though there are various policies that could be considered.
0. False Cause
	1. A logical fallacy where someone assumes that because one event happened before another, the first event must have caused the second. This reasoning overlooks other possible factors or causes that might have contributed to the second event. Just because two events are related in time does not necessarily mean one caused the other.
	2. Harris said "What he ended up doing is under Donald Trump's presidency, he ended up selling American chips to China to help them improve and modernize their military"
	3. In this example, the United States may have exported semiconductors to China before China's military modernization began. However, saying that the export caused China's military modernization is too simple and cause misunderstand. Many factors of China's military modernization are involved, like China's own research and development or getting technology from other countries. By ignoring these other factors, the statement risks misleading people into thinking the semiconductor exports were the sole or primary cause of China’s military advancements.
	4. Voters who see China as a rival, especially supporters of Trump, might misunderstand this statement. They could misunderstand the context of the semiconductor exports and believe that Trump increased China's military power and betrayed the United States because of how the statement is framed.
0. Straw Figure
	1. A logical fallacy where someone misrepresents, exaggerates, or distorts an opponents's argument to make it easier to attack. Instead of engaging with the actual position or argument, the speaker creates a "straw figure"
	2. Trump had debate about abortion, and he said "The Democrats are radical in that. And her vice president -- by Springer to pick who I thought was a horrible. Our country because he is really out of it. But her vice presidential picked says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. He also says, execution after birth, execution can no longer abortion because the baby is born, is okay. And that is not okay with me."
	3. Trump misrepresented the Democrats' and Harris's position or opinion. He falsely claimed that "abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine" and "execution after birth... is okay." These claims have no basis in any official statements or records. Trump created a straw figure and attacked this fabricated version of his opponents instead of addressing their actual stance.
	4. This fallacy is likely to influence or convince conservative voters and undecided voters. Conservative voters may already hold strong anti-abortion beliefs, and such exaggerated claims align with their fears, reinforcing their biases. Undecided voters, especially those who are unaware of the actual policies or statements of the Democrats, might accept these exaggerated claims as truth, making them less likely to support the opposing side.
0. False Dilemma
	1. A logical fallacy that is presented as having only two options, ignoring other possibilities or alternatives.
	2. Harris said "Understand, if Donald Trump were to be reelected, he will sign the initial abortion ban. Understand in his Project 2025, there would be a national abortion ban, a monitor that would be monitoring your pregnancies, your miscarriages."
	3. Harris presents a condition. If Trump is reelected, there will be a nationwide abortion ban, and pregnancies and miscarriages will be monitored. If not, abortion rights would be restored. This false dilemma may ignore other possibilities, such as individual states continuing to decide their own abortion laws. By presenting only these two extreme outcomes, Harris simplifies the debate, leaving no room for alternative scenarios. This fits the definition of false dilemma.
	4. Voters who
