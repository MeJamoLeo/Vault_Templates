> Please investigate one of the laws below and explain the law and explain whether you think Texas should pass a similar law, or no. These laws vary in focus, from privacy and consumer rights to protections against discrimination and personal autonomy.
> 
> - California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) - Enhances privacy rights for California residents, giving them more control over their personal information.
> - Colorado’s Red Flag Law - Allows law enforcement to remove firearms from individuals deemed a threat to themselves or others, balancing public safety and Second Amendment rights.
> - Oregon’s Death with Dignity Act - Allows terminally ill patients to choose to end their lives through assisted suicide, highlighting personal autonomy and end-of-life rights.
> - Washington’s Paid Family and Medical Leave Act - Provides paid leave for family and medical reasons, addressing workers' rights and family welfare.
> - San Francisco's Fair Chance Ordinance - Prohibits employers from asking about a job applicant's criminal history until after a conditional offer of employment, addressing issues of employment discrimination against individuals with criminal records.
> - Seattle's Secure Scheduling Ordinance - Requires employers in the retail and food service industries to provide workers with predictable work schedules, promoting labor rights and job security.
> - Los Angeles' Proposition HHH - Allocates funding for the construction of permanent supportive housing for the homeless, addressing housing rights and homelessness issues.
> - Philadelphia's Automatic Voter Registration Law - Automatically registers eligible voters when they interact with certain government agencies, expanding access to the electoral process.
> - Baltimore’s Right to Counsel Law - Provides legal representation for low-income tenants facing eviction, addressing housing rights and access to justice.
> 
> Please write up the following about the law you choose:
> 
> 1. Give the name of the law and the year it was passed.
> 2. Was the law passed by the state legislature or city government, or was it directly approved by voters? (For example, the California law was something voters voted directly on rather than being a law that was initiated and passed through the state legislature).
> 3. Summarize what the law did and who would be covered by the law. For example, the Oregon law allows assistance in dying if specific circumstances are present such as age, diagnosis, etc and you would want to explain that. As another example, the San Francisco law might apply to most employers but not police departments, or the Seattle law might not apply to businesses with fewer than 10 employees. Add spending information if you choose the Los Angeles law - that is, how much was allocated to this program?
> 4. Should Texas have a similar law in your view, why or why not?

1. Secure Scheduling, July 1, 2017
2. On September 19, 2016, the Seattle City Council passed the Secure Scheduling Ordinance (SSO), CB 118765, by a unanimous vote.
3. The Secure Scheduling Ordinance applies to hourly employees at large retail and food service companies with more than 500 workers worldwide, and to full-service restaurants with more than 40 locations. Under this law, employers must follow certain rules. They must display a poster with the rules in English and the main languages of their employees where everyone can see it. They must give new employees a written estimate of how many hours they will work and whether on-call shifts are required, and give updated estimates each year or when schedules change greatly. Employers must post work schedules at least 14 days before they start and allow workers to refuse added hours not listed in the original schedule. They must consider requests for schedule changes, especially for major life events, unless there is a strong business reason not to. Before hiring new workers, they must offer extra hours to current employees. They must pay extra if a worker has less than 10 hours off between closing and opening shifts. They must also pay extra if they add hours or change shifts after posting the schedule, send employees home early, or fail to call in on-call workers. Finally, employers must keep records for three years to prove they are following these rules.
4. I am against Texas adopting a secure scheduling law like the one in Seattle. First, even large retail and restaurant chains would lose flexibility in setting work shifts. This would make it harder to respond quickly to sudden changes in demand or unexpected staff shortages. Also, some parts of Texas often face hurricanes. Since it is impossible to predict these storms 14 days in advance, requiring schedules to be set that far ahead does not match the reality of the situation. 
   In addition, companies are starting to use AI to manage labor resources. They need to compare the cost of using AI tools with the cost of paying extra fees when changing work shifts. Texas is known for being friendly to businesses by keeping minimum wages and taxes low to attract large companies. If new regulations create extra costs for retailers and restaurants, these businesses might move to other states or reduce their operations, which would hurt the Texas economy. 
   For these reasons, I believe Texas should be very careful before adopting such a law.
