> Please investigate one of the laws below and explain the law and explain whether you think Texas should pass a similar law, or no. These laws vary in focus, from privacy and consumer rights to protections against discrimination and personal autonomy.
> 
> - California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) - Enhances privacy rights for California residents, giving them more control over their personal information.
> - Colorado’s Red Flag Law - Allows law enforcement to remove firearms from individuals deemed a threat to themselves or others, balancing public safety and Second Amendment rights.
> - Oregon’s Death with Dignity Act - Allows terminally ill patients to choose to end their lives through assisted suicide, highlighting personal autonomy and end-of-life rights.
> - Washington’s Paid Family and Medical Leave Act - Provides paid leave for family and medical reasons, addressing workers' rights and family welfare.
> - San Francisco's Fair Chance Ordinance - Prohibits employers from asking about a job applicant's criminal history until after a conditional offer of employment, addressing issues of employment discrimination against individuals with criminal records.
> - Seattle's Secure Scheduling Ordinance - Requires employers in the retail and food service industries to provide workers with predictable work schedules, promoting labor rights and job security.
> - Los Angeles' Proposition HHH - Allocates funding for the construction of permanent supportive housing for the homeless, addressing housing rights and homelessness issues.
> - Philadelphia's Automatic Voter Registration Law - Automatically registers eligible voters when they interact with certain government agencies, expanding access to the electoral process.
> - Baltimore’s Right to Counsel Law - Provides legal representation for low-income tenants facing eviction, addressing housing rights and access to justice.
> 
> Please write up the following about the law you choose:
> 
> 1. Give the name of the law and the year it was passed.
> 2. Was the law passed by the state legislature or city government, or was it directly approved by voters? (For example, the California law was something voters voted directly on rather than being a law that was initiated and passed through the state legislature).
> 3. Summarize what the law did and who would be covered by the law. For example, the Oregon law allows assistance in dying if specific circumstances are present such as age, diagnosis, etc and you would want to explain that. As another example, the San Francisco law might apply to most employers but not police departments, or the Seattle law might not apply to businesses with fewer than 10 employees. Add spending information if you choose the Los Angeles law - that is, how much was allocated to this program?
> 4. Should Texas have a similar law in your view, why or why not?

1. Secure Scheduling, July 1, 2017
2. On September 19, 2016, the Seattle City Council passed the Secure Scheduling Ordinance (SSO), CB 118765, by a unanimous vote.
3. This rule tells big retail and food companies how to give workers clear and fair work schedules. There are four main points. Advance Notice of Schedules: Employers must tell workers their schedule at least 14 days before it starts. Compensation for Schedule Changes: If employers change the schedule with less than 14 days' notice, they must pay workers extra money. Rest Between Shifts: Workers must have at least 10 hours off between shifts. If they work with less than 10 hours of rest, they should get extra pay (time-and-a-half). Access to Extra Hours: Employers must give extra work hours to current part-time workers before hiring new people. This rule applies to retail and food businesses with 500 or more employees worldwide. For full-service restaurants, the rule only applies if they have 40 or more restaurants worldwide.
4. I am against Texas adopting a secure scheduling law like the one in Seattle. First, even large retail and restaurant chains would lose flexibility in setting work shifts. This would make it harder to respond quickly to sudden changes in demand or unexpected staff shortages. Also, some parts of Texas often face hurricanes. Since it is impossible to predict these storms 14 days in advance, requiring schedules to be set that far ahead does not match the reality of the situation. 
   In addition, companies are starting to use AI to manage labor resources. They need to compare the cost of using AI tools with the cost of paying extra fees when changing work shifts. Texas is known for being friendly to businesses by keeping minimum wages and taxes low to attract large companies. If new regulations create extra costs for retailers and restaurants, these businesses might move to other states or reduce their operations, which would hurt the Texas economy. 
   For these reasons, I believe Texas should be very careful before adopting such a law.
