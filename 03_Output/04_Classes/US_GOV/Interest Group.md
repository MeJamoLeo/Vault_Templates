> **Activity #9 – Interest Groups** 
> 
> Interest groups want to influence governmental policy and most also want to influence who wins election to the national and state political offices. For this activity,  choose one interest group to focus on and write up answers to questions 1-5. Examples of interest groups include these below, and [groups on this list](https://usapoliticaldatabase.weebly.com/list-of-interest-groups.html) :
> 
> - an  interest group related to your future profession, such as a group that represents teachers, or fire fighters, doctors, lawyers, etc. 
>     
> - an interest group that represents groups of people such as the NOW (National Organization for Women), The NAACP,  LULAC (League of United Latin American Citizens), The Human Rights Campaign, AARP (American Association of Retired Persons), AAPD (American Association of People with Disabilities),etc. 
>     
> - an interest group that has a single issue focus or narrow issue focus,  such as The World Wildlife Foundation or The Nature Conservancy; the NRA (National Rifle Association), Brady United or Giffords Law Center (pro gun control); the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union), Human Rights Watch; a pro-life or pro-choice group, or any other group that aligns with specific political or social issues you want to learn about.

> - 1.Name the interest group you chose and include a link to its website.
> ```
> National Restaurant Association
> ```
> - 2.Research the Interest Group. Go to its website and look around in the various menu sections and 
> 	- a.Provide a brief overview of the interest group you have selected, including its founding and mission
> 	- b.Explain the interest group’s position on one or two issues. For example, a group that’s focused on ending the death penalty might discuss issues within that area such as unreliable eyewitness testimony, jury bias, etc. A broad group like the NAACP might discuss criminal justice, health care and other topics.
> 	- c.Analyze the language used for the issue or issues you looked at. We know that the group needs people to care about their issues, and see that working on those issues is urgently needed, and that accept the groups’ recommendations. Explain how the group seeks to do this (this could be in a section called “Take Action” or “Get Involved” but look in every menu link so you don’t overlook it.

> National Restaurant Association was founded in 1919 and represents the restaurant and foodservice industry in United States. Its mission is to support the success of restaurants and related businesses.
> 
> National Restaurant Association is concerned about high credit card processing fees (called “swipe fees”). In the United States, just two companies control 80% of the credit card market, which makes these fees very expensive. These costs are so high that, for many restaurants, paying swipe fees is their third biggest expense after food and labor. To fix this problem, the Association supports the Credit Card Competition Act. This law would create more competition in the credit card market, lower swipe fees, improve security, and save businesses and consumers about $15 billion a year.ここでは"continue to skyrocketやunsustainableなど，緊急性を強調する言葉使いと"two companies control 80% of the credit card market"のように具体的な数字を用いることで読者への関心，危機感を創出している．
>
> In addition to the swipe fees issue, this association also supports keeping the current “tip credit” system. In full-service restaurants, the tip credit allows servers to earn good wages through tips, often more than the minimum wage, and helps restaurants keep prices affordable. Because servers can earn a high hourly rate from tips, many prefer this system. Most restaurant customers also like the tip credit because it keeps their favorite dining experiences more affordable.このセクションではTipped Wage EmployeeがMinimum Wage Employeeと比較して，どれほど多く稼いでいるかを書いている．この図はTip Credit制度の有用性と社会に対するメリットを読者に伝えることに役に立っている．
> ```
> - 3.Still on the group’s website, look for any endorsements (look in every menu link because it is not always titled “endorsements”, and find whether the interest group has endorsed any presidential candidate in the current election campaign. If they have, include the following: The candidate they endorsed and a summary of what they wrote about that candidate, or the opposing candidate. If they have not, explain whether you think their views would most likely be consistent with the Democratic candidate or the Republican candidate and explain why.

> このAssosiationは全体的に労働者保護よりも，経営者側の視点の政策が多いため共和党の思想に近いと言えるだろう．この団体は最低賃金の引き上げに対して慎重な姿勢を示し，チップ制度を支持している．これは人件費を抑えることに繋がり，ビジネスオーナーにとっては有利に働く．従って共和党の思想に近い．
> ```
> - 4.Explain your thinking: Do you support what the group’s goals are, explain.
> ```
> 私はこの団体に同意できる部分もあるが，全体的にはサポートしない．なぜなら全ての主張が経営者目線であり，消費者目線ではないからだ．チップ制度は消費者に

- [o] Research a list of interest groups based on your interests or future profession.
- [o] Select one interest group that you want to focus on.
	- [National Restaurant Association | National Restaurant Association](https://restaurant.org)
- [o] Note the name of the group and find its official website.
	- National Restaurant Association
	- https://restaurant.org
- [o] Save the website link for reference.
- [o] Navigate to the "About Us" or "Our Mission" section of the group's website.
	- https://restaurant.org/about-us/what-we-do/our-mission/
- [o] Summarize its founding history and mission in a few sentences.**Part A**
	- The National Restaurant Association (NRA) was founded in 1919 during a period of significant national growth and transformation. Initially established to support a burgeoning foodservice industry, the NRA has spent over a century championing the interests of the restaurant sector. Its mission is to strengthen operations, mitigate risks, develop talent, advocate for business vitality at all governmental levels, and foster knowledge and collaboration. Today, the association represents one of the nation's largest private-sector industries, serving as a cornerstone of community development and economic growth.
- [o] Write down key details, such as founding year, purpose, and notable achievements.
- [o] Browse the site for their key focus areas or issues (look under menus like “Issues,” “Advocacy,” or “What We Do”).
- [o] Choose one or two issues the group focuses on and read the related content.
	- [Swipe Fees | National Restaurant Association](https://restaurant.org/issues-and-advocacy/policy-agenda/swipefees/)
	- [Tip Credit | National Restaurant Association](https://restaurant.org/issues-and-advocacy/policy-agenda/tipping/)
	- [FTC Surcharge Ban | National Restaurant Association](https://restaurant.org/issues-and-advocacy/policy-agenda/ftc-surcharge-ban/)
- [ ] Summarize the group’s position on these issues, including any evidence or arguments they provide. **Part B**
	- The National Restaurant Association (NRA) advocates for two critical issues affecting the restaurant industry.
	  The first issue is Credit Card Swipe Fees. The NRA supports the Credit Card Competition Act (CCCA) to lower swipe fees, which are very high in the U.S. because only two companies control most of the credit card market. These fees have doubled in the last ten years and are the third biggest cost for restaurants, after food and labor. The CCCA will reduce fees, improve security, and save businesses and customers about $15 billion a year. Without this law, the fees will keep rising, which is a big problem for small restaurants.
