> **Activity #9 – Interest Groups** 
> 
> Interest groups want to influence governmental policy and most also want to influence who wins election to the national and state political offices. For this activity,  choose one interest group to focus on and write up answers to questions 1-5. Examples of interest groups include these below, and [groups on this list](https://usapoliticaldatabase.weebly.com/list-of-interest-groups.html) :
> 
> - an  interest group related to your future profession, such as a group that represents teachers, or fire fighters, doctors, lawyers, etc. 
>     
> - an interest group that represents groups of people such as the NOW (National Organization for Women), The NAACP,  LULAC (League of United Latin American Citizens), The Human Rights Campaign, AARP (American Association of Retired Persons), AAPD (American Association of People with Disabilities),etc. 
>     
> - an interest group that has a single issue focus or narrow issue focus,  such as The World Wildlife Foundation or The Nature Conservancy; the NRA (National Rifle Association), Brady United or Giffords Law Center (pro gun control); the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union), Human Rights Watch; a pro-life or pro-choice group, or any other group that aligns with specific political or social issues you want to learn about.

> - 1.Name the interest group you chose and include a link to its website.
> ```
> National Restaurant Association

> - 2.Research the Interest Group. Go to its website and look around in the various menu sections and 
> 	- a.Provide a brief overview of the interest group you have selected, including its founding and mission
> 	- b.Explain the interest group’s position on one or two issues. For example, a group that’s focused on ending the death penalty might discuss issues within that area such as unreliable eyewitness testimony, jury bias, etc. A broad group like the NAACP might discuss criminal justice, health care and other topics.
> 	- c.Analyze the language used for the issue or issues you looked at. We know that the group needs people to care about their issues, and see that working on those issues is urgently needed, and that accept the groups’ recommendations. Explain how the group seeks to do this (this could be in a section called “Take Action” or “Get Involved” but look in every menu link so you don’t overlook it.

> National Restaurant Association was founded in 1919 and represents the restaurant and foodservice industry in United States. Its mission is to support the success of restaurants and related businesses.
> 
> National Restaurant Association is concerned about high credit card processing fees (called “swipe fees”). In the United States, just two companies control 80% of the credit card market, which makes these fees very expensive. These costs are so high that, for many restaurants, paying swipe fees is their third biggest expense after food and labor. To fix this problem, the Association supports the Credit Card Competition Act. This law would create more competition in the credit card market, lower swipe fees, improve security, and save businesses and consumers about $15 billion a year.ここでは"continue to skyrocketやunsustainableなど，緊急性を強調する言葉使いと"two companies control 80% of the credit card market"のように具体的な数字を用いることで読者への関心，危機感を創出している．

> In addition to the swipe fees issue, this association also supports keeping the current “tip credit” system. In full-service restaurants, the tip credit allows servers to earn good wages through tips, often more than the minimum wage, and helps restaurants keep prices affordable. Because servers can earn a high hourly rate from tips, many prefer this system. Most restaurant customers also like the tip credit because it keeps their favorite dining experiences more affordable.このセクションではTipped Wage EmployeeがMinimum Wage Employeeと比較して，どれほど多く稼いでいるかを書いている．この図はTip Credit制度の有用性と社会に対するメリットを読者に伝えることに役に立っている．

> - 3.Still on the group’s website, look for any endorsements (look in every menu link because it is not always titled “endorsements”, and find whether the interest group has endorsed any presidential candidate in the current election campaign. If they have, include the following: The candidate they endorsed and a summary of what they wrote about that candidate, or the opposing candidate. If they have not, explain whether you think their views would most likely be consistent with the Democratic candidate or the Republican candidate and explain why.

> このAssosiationは全体的に労働者保護よりも，経営者側の視点の政策が多いため共和党の思想に近いと言えるだろう．この団体は最低賃金の引き上げに対して慎重な姿勢を示し，チップ制度を支持している．これは人件費を抑えることに繋がり，ビジネスオーナーにとっては有利に働く．従って共和党の思想に近い．

> - 4.Explain your thinking: Do you support what the group’s goals are, explain.

>私はこの団体は支持しません。その理由は、団体の提案が経営者目線に偏っており、消費者や労働者の視点が十分に考慮されていないからです。特にチップ制度には大きな問題があると考えています。
> チップ制度は、レストラン経営者が従業員の人件費の一部を消費者に負担させる仕組みであり、価格の透明性を損なうものです。この仕組みにより、消費者はチップをオプションではなく、義務的な支出として捉えるようになっています。また、グループ料金やピーク料金などのサーチャージも同様に、メニュー価格と最終的な請求額の間にギャップを生じさせ、消費者が意図しない追加料金を支払う状況を生み出しています。これらは、消費者の不信感や予測不可能な支出を引き起こします。
> これに対し、現在のような制度としてのチップの仕組みを廃止し、最低賃金を引き上げることは、より公平で透明性のある解決策だと考えます。最低賃金の引き上げにより、労働者はチップに依存せず安定した収入を得られるようになります。これにより、労働者の収入が消費者の気分や評価に左右されることなく、計画的な生活が可能となります。さらに、制度としてのチップを廃止することで、経営者が従業員に直接支払う給与が明確になり、消費者も支払い金額を事前に予測できるため、価格の透明性が向上します。これにより、消費者はレストランの価格設定やサービスを正当に評価できるようになるでしょう。
> また、最低賃金の引き上げやチップ制度の見直しは、レストラン業界における新陳代謝を促すと考えられます。競争環境が健全化することで、新しいビジネスモデルやサービスが市場に登場しやすくなり、消費者はより高品質な料理やサービスを享受できるようになります。新規参入が増えることで、業界全体が活性化し、消費者にとって魅力的な選択肢が増えることが期待されます。
> このような理由から、私はこの団体の主張に一部賛同できる部分はあるものの、全体的には支持することはできません。

These fees have doubled in the last ten years and are the third biggest cost for restaurants, after food and labor. The CCCA will reduce fees, improve security, and save businesses and customers about $15 billion a year. Without this law, the fees will keep rising, which is a big problem for small restaurants.

#### a. Overview of the Interest Group

The National Restaurant Association was founded in 1919 and represents the restaurant and foodservice industry in the United States. Its mission is to support the success of restaurants and related businesses. 

#### b. The Interest Group’s Position on Issues

The National Restaurant Association focuses on several key issues. One of them is **high credit card processing fees**, also known as "swipe fees." In the U.S., just two companies control 80% of the credit card market, resulting in some of the highest fees in the world. For many restaurants, swipe fees are their third-largest expense after food and labor. To address this issue, the association supports the **Credit Card Competition Act**, which aims to create more competition, lower fees, improve security, and save businesses and consumers $15 billion annually. They use phrases like “continue to skyrocket” and “unsustainable” to stress the urgency of this problem, along with specific data such as "two companies control 80% of the credit card market" to capture readers’ attention.

Another issue the association supports is the **current tip credit system**. In full-service restaurants, tip credit allows servers to earn more through tips while helping restaurants keep prices affordable. They highlight that tipped employees often earn significantly more than minimum wage, with some making a median of $27 per hour. Visual comparisons, such as graphs showing tipped employees earning more than minimum-wage workers, are used to emphasize the benefits of the tip credit system.

#### c. Language and Messaging Analysis

The language the association uses is designed to create urgency and emphasize the importance of these issues. For example, words like “skyrocket” and “unsustainable” make the problems sound critical, encouraging immediate action.

The association also uses direct calls to action, such as “Tell Congress to pass the Credit Card Competition Act.” This not only explains what readers should do but makes it easy for them to get involved.

### 3. Endorsements

The National Restaurant Association does not explicitly endorse any presidential candidate on their website. However, based on their positions, the group’s views are more aligned with Republican policies. This is because they focus on keeping labor costs low, such as opposing minimum wage increases and supporting the tip credit system. These positions tend to favor business owners, which aligns more closely with Republican priorities.

### 4. Explain Your Thinking

I do not support the National Restaurant Association’s overall goals. While I agree with the need to address high swipe fees, I believe their support for the tip credit system is problematic. The current tip system shifts part of the labor cost from business owners to consumers, which reduces price transparency. Consumers often feel obligated to tip, making it less of an optional payment and more of a hidden charge. Additionally, surcharges like group fees or peak fees create a gap between menu prices and the actual bill, leading to unplanned expenses for consumers.

I believe the tip credit system should be abolished, and restaurants should move to a fairer system where wages are directly paid by employers. Increasing the minimum wage would provide workers with stable income and reduce reliance on tips. This would allow workers to plan their lives without depending on unpredictable tips based on customer preferences or mood. For consumers, it would make costs more predictable and transparent, helping them fairly evaluate the value of a restaurant’s service and pricing.

Additionally, replacing the tip system with higher wages could encourage healthier competition in the restaurant industry. A fair system would allow new businesses and ideas to emerge, offering consumers better quality food and service. This could lead to a more dynamic and innovative industry with diverse options for customers.

For these reasons, while I can support some of the association’s goals, such as lowering swipe fees, I cannot fully support their overall agenda. The focus on benefiting business owners at the expense of transparency and fairness for consumers and workers makes their approach unbalanced.
