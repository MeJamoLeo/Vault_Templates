> **Activity #8 – Fact checking**
> 
> There has likely never been more lying and misinformation in politics in America than there is today. This is because groups and individuals seem to make stuff up and post it on social media and other people then spread that misinformation thinking it’s true because they heard it or read it somewhere.

	- PolitiFact investigated claims that Elon Musk's Starlink technology was used to manipulate votes in the 2024 presidential election in favor of Donald Trump.
	  Federal and state election officials have refuted allegations of widespread fraud in the 2024 election, including assertions that Starlink interfered with vote counts. They emphasized that established systems ensure votes are accurately and fairly tabulated.
	  In key swing states such as Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, election security protocols mandate that voting equipment remains disconnected from the internet during ballot counting. Experts confirm that, generally, voting machines are not connected to the internet, making external manipulation via technologies like Starlink implausible. Additionally, reports of a Starlink satellite reentering Earth's atmosphere and exploding on November 10 were noted. However, experts clarified that such reentries occur almost daily and are not unusual, further debunking the notion that this event was linked to election interference. Consequently, PolitiFact rated the claim as "Pants on Fire," signifying it as a blatantly false statement.
