> **Activity #8 – Fact checking**
> 
> There has likely never been more lying and misinformation in politics in America than there is today. This is because groups and individuals seem to make stuff up and post it on social media and other people then spread that misinformation thinking it’s true because they heard it or read it somewhere.

> d.Politifact found the quote false saying the claim that people were being paid to attend events for Harris and events to protest Trump are not new. They have been made before apparently many times, and those claims were also determined to be false. In this one, someone said their nail tech told them someone’s cousin was being paid $100 per day to go wherever Harris’s campaign asked them to go. And the post said the person is “not even a citizen”, which I guess was meant to make it worse. Politifact searched Nexus, Reuters and Google and found no support for this. They also found that the person who posted it also posts other false pro-Trump claims which they suggested further brings doubt on its truthfulness.

	- PolitiFact investigated claims that Elon Musk's Starlink technology was used to manipulate votes in the 2024 presidential election in favor of Donald Trump.
	  Federal and state election officials have refuted allegations of widespread fraud in the 2024 election, including assertions that Starlink interfered with vote counts. They emphasized that established systems ensure votes are accurately and fairly tabulated.
	  In key swing states such as Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, election security protocols mandate that voting equipment remains disconnected from the internet during ballot counting. Experts confirm that, generally, voting machines are not connected to the internet, making external manipulation via technologies like Starlink implausible.
	  Additionally, reports of a Starlink satellite reentering Earth's atmosphere and exploding on November 10 were noted. Some people spread false information by linking its reentry to election interference. They claimed that the "Starlink satellite was destroyed" as proof of election manipulation. However, experts clarified that such reentries occur almost daily and are not unusual, further debunking the notion that this event was linked to election interference.
	  In sum, Politifact rated the claim as "Pants on Fire," signifying it as a blatantly false statement.

	- [Typo in Trump's Name on Ballot Review Screen Is Not 'Election Fraud' - FactCheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/11/typo-in-trumps-name-on-ballot-review-screen-is-not-election-fraud/)
	- False
	- On Instagram, there is a post that shows a video former President Donald Trump's name is misspelled as "Triump" on a ballot review screen. The accompanying text questions, "Why is there an I in Donald J Trump's name?" The error was claimed on social media as "election fraud". FactCheck.org determined this claim to be false. The misspelling occurred on an optional ballot review screen in Washington County, Virginia, due to a typographical error. Election officials clarified that this error appeared only on the review screen, not on the actual paper ballots, and did not affect vote tabulation or results. The optional review screen is activated only if a voter specifically requests it before inserting their ballot. Out of over 10,000 voters in the county, fewer than twenty used this feature. The error was discovered too late to reprogram the equipment before the election, but all voting equipment was thoroughly tested and operated as intended, ensuring accurate vote counting.

	- [A video shows a former employee of the Harris County Democratic Party in Texas screaming at a small child outside of Vice President Kamala Harris’ Houston rally on Friday](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-misinformation-houston-rally-confrontation-99af1f80eb43d31966cae8e68dbc3415)
	- False
	- AP News debunked the claim that Jordan Bowen, a former director for the Harris County Democratic Party (HCDP), was the woman shouting at a child outside Kamala Harris's rally in Houston. The HCDP clarified on Facebook that the woman in the video was not Bowen and had no connection to the party. Bowen attended the rally but was dressed differently, wearing a gray shirt, glasses, and a rainbow “HOU” cap, while the woman in the video wore a crop top, shorts, and had braided hair. The false claim led to harassment, including death threats and Bowen’s mother’s private information being shared online. Bowen, shocked by the misinformation, is now working with a lawyer to explore legal action. The HCDP also reported that false accusations disrupted their work and prompted armed security visits due to threatening messages. HCDP’s chief of staff called the claims “completely fake” and emphasized the harm caused by spreading unverified information.
