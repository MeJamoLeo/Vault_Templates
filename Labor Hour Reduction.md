# Issue
I've noticed that there is no rule for how to approach labor hours when someone does not stay the entire week at Ruth. Because of this, hours are allocated based on the labor steward's preference. I thought setting a rule could standardize this process.

# Proposal
- Staying 7 days in a week -> 4 hours
- Staying 6 days in a week -> 4 hours
- Staying 5 days in a week -> 3 hours
- Staying 4 days in a week -> 2 hours
- Staying 3 days in a week -> 2 hours
- Staying 2 days in a week -> 1 hours
- Staying 1 day in a week -> 0 hours
- Staying 0 days in a week -> 0 hours

# Posibility
- Staying 7 days in a week -> 4 hours
- Staying 6 days in a week -> 3.5 hours
- Staying 5 days in a week -> 3 hours
- Staying 4 days in a week -> 2.5 hours
- Staying 3 days in a week -> 2 hours
- Staying 2 days in a week -> 1.5 hours
- Staying 1 day in a week -> 1 hours
- Staying 0 days in a week -> 0 hours
